# Installing windows10 on a laptop with PXE
1. connect the laptop to the network switch (use an ethernet to usb adapter if there is no ethernet port)
2. spam f11 or some other BIOS booting key
3. change the "USB ethernet adaptor", "USB network adaptor", "ethernet", or similarly named boot device to boot first, either by selecting it from the boot device menu, or by changing the boot device order in the BIOS or UEFI settings
4. ??? (need computer with actually broken windows install to test)
